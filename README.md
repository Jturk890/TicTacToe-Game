# TicTacToe-Game

# Project Description

This Java program is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Swing library for graphical user interface (GUI). 
Technologies used in this program:
Java: The core programming language used to develop the application.
Swing: A GUI toolkit for Java that provides a set of components for building desktop applications. 
In this case, Swing is used to create the graphical interface with buttons, labels, and input fields.
ActionListener: Interface from the java.awt.event package, used for handling button clicks and other GUI events.
The biggest challange I faced when creating this program was the learning curve when learning Swing. 


Finally to be able to run this program, make sure you can use Swing.
